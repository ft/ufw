# This is the emulation-based program runner for the ufw test-suite. This
# script runs an ARM Cortex-M3 program via QEMU. It enables semihosting, and
# disables all graphical output. That way, stdio is connected to that of the
# QEMU process.
#
# This also disables reboot, when the program being run issues a system reset
# command, which makes QEMU exit instead.
#
# With both of these features in place, it is possible to run Cortex-M3 appli-
# cations in QEMU and have them exit after they are done, which is perfect for
# running ufw's test-suite. That test-suite uses TAP output, which means this
# script is suitable for prove(1)'s ‘--exec’ option.
