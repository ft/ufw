CMake Build Type to Zephyr Build Optimisation Mapping
-----------------------------------------------------

The kconfig snippets contained within this directory try to map the usual CMake
build type nomenclature to zephyr's kconfig options.  Here is a run down of the
involved options and what they do with respect to the GNU toolchain's compiler.

  - CONFIG_SIZE_OPTIMIZATIONS If set to 'y', enables -Os.
  - CONFIG_SPEED_OPTIMIZATIONS If set to 'y', enables -O2.
  - CONFIG_DEBUG_OPTIMIZATIONS: If set to 'y', enables -Og.
  - CONFIG_NO_OPTIMIZATIONS: If set to 'y', enables -O0.

The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE variable is lower-cased  and if a corresponding .conf file
exists in this  directory, it is loaded at configuration  time. For example, if
the build type  is configured to be "Release" this  causes "release.conf" to be
loaded.
