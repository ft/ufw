# This is a makemehappy configuration, that enables exactly one toolchain for a
# single architecture (afl++-native), one build tool (ninja) and one build con-
# figuration (debug). Using  this, you can run larger builds,  that are managed
# by makemehappy to  build through the AFL++  instrumented compiler implementa-
# tion, thus allowing to efficiently run produced binaries through "afl-fuzz".
