# Commentary:
#
# This is an experimental test-suite  runner that emits TAP output, implemented
# for  POSIX  shells.  It  supports deterministic  and  non-deterministic  test
# suites, prerequisites, as well as setup and teardown phases.
#
# The main driver  is the "tap" function. Deterministic test  suites should use
# the "plan"  function at the  beginning of their  execution. Non-deterministic
# test-suites should call  the "noplan" function at the very  end of their exe-
# cution.
#
# The "tap" function works like this:
#
#   tap [OPTION(s)...] <TEST-RUNNER> <TEST-TITLE>
#
# The TEST-RUNNER  and TEST-TITLE arguments  are non-optional. The latter  is a
# string, that  should describe  the test  that is executed,  short and  to the
# point. The  TEST-RUNNER argument is  something executable: Often  a function,
# but external programs and scripts also work. It is called with zero arguments
# and its return-code (success or failure) determine the result of the test.
#
# Available options of "tap":
#
#   -p <PREREQUISITE-RUNNER>
#         This option takes something executable, and if this executions
#         indicates failure, it causes the test to be skipped. Successful
#         execution causes the test to be carried out.
#
#   -s <SETUP-RUNNER>
#         This option takes something executable, and runs it just before
#         a test is executed. If a prerequisite runner failed, this option
#         is ignored. The runner should return success. Failure will emit
#         a warning.
#
#   -t <TEARDOWN-RUNNER>
#         This option is similar to "-s", only that the runner gets executed
#         just AFTER a test is executed.
#
# There are also two pre-commands for "tap", that modify a test's behaviour:
#
#   SKIP tap ...
#         This marks a test as skipped and sets its result to success. Any
#         runner options (-p, -s, and -t) will have no effect and the test
#         runner itself is not executed either.
#
#   TODO tap ...
#         This marks a test as known-to-fail. The execution of all runners
#         is carried out as normal, but TAP harnesses will not fail a suite
#         with a failing test that is marked TODO.
#
# Example:
#
# plan 1
#
# setup () {
#     printf '# I am a setup procedure!\n'
# }
#
# teardown () {
#     printf '# I am a teardown procedure!\n'
# }
#
# prereq () {
#     printf '# I am a prerequisite that always succeeds!\n'
# }
#
# the_test () {
#     printf '# I am a test that always succeeds!\n'
# }
#
# tap -s setup -t teardown -p prereq the_test 'Example test passes'
#
# Output:
#
# 1..1
# # I am a prerequisite that always succeeds!
# # I am a setup procedure!
# # I am a test that always succeeds!
# # I am a teardown procedure!
# ok 1 - Example test passes
