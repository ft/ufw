This is a tiny  mmh system to check if using mmh as  a zephyr module works. You
need to setup the zephyr kernel at  version 3.7.0 at "zephyr" and ufw in "ufw".
The "setup" script helps with that:

  % ./setup ZEPHYR-CHECKOUT-DIRECTORY


Example:

  % ./setup ~/src/zephyr


In case you don't have zephyr checkout of the right version for the tests lying
around, you can  use "download" in place  of the directory name,  and the setup
utility will clone the right version for you into the "zephyr" subdirectory:

  % ./setup download


After that you can  just run mmh to build the system. You  can also use the run
helper for convenience:

  % ./run


This helper produces TAP  output, so you can run it in  tap-harness or prove as
well:

  % prove -v -c run
  % tap-harness -v -c run


The helper makes the TAP test into a SKIPped test if "setup" was not run.
