 * @file endpoints/core.c
 * @brief Implementation of a Sink and Source abstraction
 *
 * This implements a generic sink and source data type. The main idea here is
 * to be able to reuse implementations of protocols like SLIP for a wide array
 * of applications.
 *
 * The API implements getting and putting octets and buffers of octets from/to
 * sources/sinks. The underlying driver can be either of those access paradigms
 * and the abstraction implements the other on top of it.
 *
 * Functions implementing endpoints must return the number of octet transmitted
 * (i.e. read or written). In case of an error, the functions must return
 * -ERRNO. Additionally, when sources run out of data permanently, they need to
 * return -ENODATA. When sinks run out of space to store date, they need to
 * return -ENOMEM. Returning zero is allowed, strictly, but will cause the
 * system to retry. If that is not meaningful with your endpoint, return a
 * meaningful error code instead. Drivers returning -EINTR will cause the
 * system to assume the operation was interrupted and it will thus retry.
 * Similarly, drivers returning -EAGAIN are assumed to be in a temporary
 * situation that prevented the previous call from performing any work, and
 * thus the system will retry as well.
 *
 * The retry-logic for values like EAGAIN and EINTR can be customised. This is
 * done by way of the "retry" member, that contains two function pointers, one
 * for initialisation purposes (run each time a transaction is performed) and
 * one for each retry step done within such a transaction. The cases in which
 * customisation happens can be selected using the "ctrl" datum, which is a bit
 * mask that should be or'ed EP_RETRY_CTRL_* macros. Finally, an arbitrary data
 * pointer is passed to the retry runner function. This can be initialised by
 * the init function and used by the run function to achieve altered behaviour
 * of the runner depending on the retry state.
 *
 * Using a data count of zero, or one bigger than SSIZE_MAX causes the API to
 * return -EINVAL.
 *
 * Some of the naming conventions used herein:
 *
 * - sts_: Source to Sink plumbing APIs
 *
 * - _cbc: Character by Character transfer APIs
 *
 * - _aux: APIs using user-supplied auxiliary buffers
 *
 * - _some: APIs that transfer some, greater than zero bytes, amount of data,
 *   determined by the system
 *
 * - _atmost: APIs that transfer some, greater than zero bytes, amount of data,
 *   determined by the user.
 *
 * - _n: APIs that transfer an exact amount of data; exactly n bytes.
 *
 * - _drain: APIs that transfer all data available in a source into a sink.
 *
 * The module offers low-level the APIs source_read() and sink_write(), which
 * implement similar functionality as POSIX read() and write(), but for
 * arbitrary sources and sinks. In most cases it is advisable to use the higher
 * level functions, that implement common issue handling on top of the these
 * low level functions.
